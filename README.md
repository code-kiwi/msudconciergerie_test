# Concierge website (static prototype)

This repository contains a static website prototype created for a family project.

## Context
The goal of this project was to design a simple and clean front-end mockup for a
concierge service based in the south of France.  
The project did not ultimately move forward beyond the prototyping phase.

## Scope
This repository focuses on:
- Static page structure
- Layout and visual presentation
- Basic user navigation

No backend or dynamic features were implemented.

## Technical stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (basic)

## Notes
This project served as a front-end design and prototyping exercise rather than
a production-ready application.
